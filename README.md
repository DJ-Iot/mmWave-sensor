# mmWave-sensor


**mmWave Sensor Research & Development Project**

This project focuses on the research and development of mmWave sensor technology for applications in 3D people counting, vital sign detection, and the integration of both algorithms into a single system. The project also includes work on Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in a 2D space at Level 2 autonomy.

The R&D effort includes running example algorithms and testing customized firmware, designed to meet specific user requirements and scenarios. The firmware is optimized for a range of customizable parameters, enabling flexibility in use across different environments.

**Key Features**
3D People Counting Algorithm: Utilizes mmWave sensor data to accurately count people in a 3D space, handling various spatial configurations and movement patterns.
Vital Sign Detection Algorithm: Tracks vital signs such as heart rate and respiration using non-contact mmWave radar, providing real-time health monitoring.
Algorithm Combination: Integrates 3D people counting with vital sign monitoring for enhanced situational awareness in applications such as crowd management, healthcare, and security.
ADAS (2D, Level 2): Focuses on mmWave radar-based detection in a 2D plane for automotive applications, contributing to Level 2 autonomy with features like lane change assistance and collision avoidance.

**Customizable Parameters**
Range: Adjust the sensor detection range to suit different environments, from short-range indoor monitoring to long-range outdoor applications.
2D/3D Mode: Toggle between 2D and 3D sensing modes for different use cases, such as ADAS (2D) and people counting (3D).
Wide-Angle Detection: Configure the sensor's field of view to cover wide angles for broader area monitoring.
Counting Limit: Set limits on the number of individuals the sensor should count in a defined area, improving efficiency in high-traffic zones.
TX/RX Power: Control the transmission (TX) and reception (RX) power levels to optimize energy consumption and detection performance based on application needs.

**Project Scope**
This project covers both the hardware and software aspects of mmWave sensor development, with a focus on enhancing existing algorithms and customizing them to meet various use cases. It also emphasizes testing and validation through real-world examples, ensuring the algorithms' performance under different conditions.
